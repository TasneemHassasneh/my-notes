# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD.

[Home](/README.md)


## Express

### 1. Explain middleware:

***Middleware*** is a concept commonly used in software development, particularly in web applications. Think of it as a helpful assistant that sits between different parts of a web application, coordinating and managing communication between them.

### 2. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

The "unopinionated" nature of Express means that it provides a lightweight and flexible foundation for building web applications, allowing developers to make their own choices regarding the structure, architecture, and tooling. It promotes freedom and creativity while putting the onus on the developers to make informed decisions based on their project's requirements and their expertise.

### 3. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

***Modularity*** allows developers to break down a software system into smaller, independent modules, bringing benefits such as reusability, maintainability, collaboration, testability, scalability, and improved code organization. It promotes efficiency, flexibility, and code quality throughout the development process.

## NPM

### 1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

9.5.1

### 2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

npm install jshint


## TDD

### 1. Explain why tests are important: 

***Tests*** are important because they give us confidence in the software, help us identify and fix issues early, ensure the software meets requirements, handle changes and updates smoothly, save time and money, and build trust with users. They are like quality checks for our software, ensuring it is safe, reliable, and functions as intended.

### 2. What are three expected benefits of testing ?

1. Improved Software Quality.
2. Early Issue Detection and Cost Savings.
3. Increased Customer Satisfaction.

### Individual Pitfalls:

1. Overlooking Edge Cases
2. Writing Ineffective or Duplicate Tests

### Team Pitfalls:

1. Lack of Test Coverage Agreement
2. Insufficient Test Maintenance

---

## CI/CD

### 1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

1. Early Detection of Integration Issues
2. Faster Feedback Loop
3. Enhanced Code Quality and Stability


### 2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

While both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment focus on automating and optimizing the software release process, the key difference lies in the final step. Continuous Delivery ensures that the software is always in a deployable state, ready for release but requires manual intervention for the actual deployment. Continuous Deployment, on the other hand, automatically deploys the changes to production as soon as they pass the automated tests, eliminating the need for manual approval.

### 3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process.

GitHub serves as a platform for version control, collaboration, code review, issue tracking, and project management. It helps teams work together effectively, maintain a clean and organized codebase, and integrate with other development tools and services. GitHub's user-friendly interface and powerful features make it a valuable asset in modern software development, enabling teams to work efficiently and deliver high-quality software.
