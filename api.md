# ES6
Classes are a template for creating objects in JavaScript. They define the structure and behavior of objects, including their properties and methods.

Regarding hoisting, class declarations in JavaScript are not hoisted like function declarations. Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript where function and variable declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, class declarations are not hoisted in the same way. If you try to use a class before it is declared, you'll get a reference error.

A constructor is a special method within a class that is called when an object is created based on that class. It is used to initialize the object's properties and perform any setup operations. The constructor method is identified by the keyword constructor and is defined within the class.

The contextual "this" refers to the current object instance that is being created or is in scope. Inside a constructor, the "this" keyword is used to refer to the object being constructed. It allows you to access and assign values to the object's properties within the constructor.

To explain this to a non-technical friend, you can use an analogy of a blueprint for building houses. A class is like a blueprint that defines the structure and specifications for houses. When you want to create an actual house based on the blueprint, you use the blueprint to construct the house. In this analogy, the constructor is like the construction process itself, where you build the house and set up everything according to the blueprint. The contextual "this" would be like the workers on the construction site who are building the house. They use "this" to refer to the house they are building and to access different parts of it while constructing it.

# Using Express Routing

In Express, routing refers to the process of determining how an application responds to client requests for different routes or URLs. It involves defining the endpoints, handling HTTP methods, and executing the appropriate code or middleware for each route.

A route path in Express is a string or pattern that defines the URL pattern to match against incoming requests. It can contain static segments and dynamic placeholders, which can be used to extract values from the URL. For example, /users/:id is a route path where :id is a dynamic placeholder that can capture the value for the id parameter.

A route method in Express refers to the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) associated with a route. Express provides corresponding methods to define routes for these HTTP methods. For example, app.get() defines a route for handling GET requests, app.post() for handling POST requests, and so on.

The next parameter in a route handler or middleware function is used to pass control to the next function in the request-response cycle. It is typically used when you want to pass the request to the next middleware or route handler to perform additional operations. You can call next() within your function to invoke the next middleware or route handler.

If next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter, it is your responsibility to ensure that it is called to pass control to the next function. If you forget to call next(), the request will hang, and the response will not be sent. It's essential to handle the next parameter correctly to ensure proper flow of execution within your application.

Typically, you would use next as a parameter and call it within a middleware function when you want to perform some operations before passing control to subsequent middleware or route handlers. It allows you to add additional processing logic and then pass the request to the next function in the chain.

# Express Routing

An Express Router is a feature in the Express framework that allows you to modularize and organize your routes into separate files or modules. It provides a way to create a mini-application within your main Express application, specifically for handling routes and middleware related to a specific portion of your application.

To initialize an Express Router in an Express server, you typically follow these steps:

First, you require the Express module in your server file:
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
Next, you create an instance of the Express Router:
javascript
Copy code
const router = express.Router();
You can then define routes and middleware specific to this router instance using methods like router.get(), router.post(), router.use(), etc.
javascript
Copy code
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Route handler logic
});

router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  // Route handler logic
});
Finally, you mount the router on a specific path in your main Express application using app.use():
javascript
Copy code
app.use('/path', router);
The above code mounts the router on the /path prefix, so any routes defined within the router will be accessible under /path in your application.

Route middleware is used in Express to perform additional processing or actions for specific routes or groups of routes. It is a function that gets executed between the request and the route handler. Route middleware can be used to add authentication, logging, error handling, data validation, or any other functionality that needs to be applied to multiple routes.

Route middleware can be defined using the router.use() method or by specifying it as a second argument in any of the route methods (get, post, etc.). Middleware functions can modify the request or response objects, call the next() function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler, or terminate the request-response cycle by sending a response. They provide a way to modularize and reuse common functionality across multiple routes in an Express application.
