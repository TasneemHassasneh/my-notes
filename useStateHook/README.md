## Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy

1. Analyze the mockup and identify components:
    * Examine the design and identify distinct components and subcomponents.
2. Name the components:
    * Give each component a meaningful name based on its purpose.
3. Create a hierarchy:
    * Organize components hierarchically, with parent components containing child components.
4. Consider data model:
    * Map components to data model structure for a natural connection.

## Step 2: Build a static version in React

1. Build a static version:
    * Implement the components using JSX, without adding interactivity.
2. Reuse components:
    * Build components that reuse other components, passing data through props.
3. Top-down or bottom-up:
    * Choose to build from top-level components or bottom-level components based on project complexity.

## Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state

1. Identify state:
    * Determine which parts of the data need to be represented as state.
2. Principles for state:
    * State should represent changing data, not be passed from a parent via props, and not be computable from existing state or props.

## Step 4: Identify where your state should live

1. Identify components using state:
    * Find components that need to render based on state.
2. Find common parent:
    * Locate the closest common parent component for components using shared state.
3. Decide where state should live:
    * Add state to the common parent or an ancestor component if necessary.

## Step 5: Add inverse data flow

1. Pass down state-altering functions:
    * Provide functions to child components so they can update the state in parent components.
2. Use onChange handlers:
    * Attach onChange event handlers to form inputs to trigger state updates.
3. Complete interactivity:
    * Allow user input to update the state and reflect changes in the UI.

## State: A Component's Memory

Components often need to change what's displayed due to interactions. This component-specific memory is known as state.

### Adding a State Variable with useState Hook

- Import `useState` from React.
* Declare a state variable using `const [variable, setVariable] = useState(initialValue);`
* `variable` holds the current state value.
* `setVariable` updates the state and triggers re-renders.

### Updating State

Use `setVariable` to update a state variable, causing component re-renders.

### State Isolation and Private

State is local to a component instance, isolated from others.

### Multiple State Variables

A component can have several state variables with separate setter functions.

### Using State Wisely

State is for data persistence and UI updates. Combine related state variables.

### Limitations of Local Variables

Local variables are insufficient for managing React component state.
