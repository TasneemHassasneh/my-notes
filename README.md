## class 01

"Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets require code to function properly. Coding allows humans to communicate with these devices. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems.

Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these messages, they complete assigned tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image.

Read on to learn about how people use code to communicate with computers and develop electronic devices, machines, and other technologies."

## what I learned from today's lecture.

1. Difference between GUI and CLI

- GUI: Graphical User Interface.It is comparatively easier to understand and use.

- CLI: Command Line Interface.It is comparatively more difficult to understand and use

2. Version Control System

- Version control systems` are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.

3. Markdown

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by **John Gruber** in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.
